#Script to read, plot, and save as .pdf for a data file


The main function of this file reads a datafile, plots the data, and saves a figure. Data files used here must be .csv. Additionally, all columns must have numbers in them, not letters or strings.

I attempted to add a 3rd argument to specify which columns of a given 'input_file' datafile to plot. This could be done with a "usecols=range(sys.argv[3])". I received too many errors and gave up.
