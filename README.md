The purpose of this script is to take data input, and plot the data. 

The user must use python to run this script. The user must input two variables to the 
command line. The first is the dataset they wish to use. The dataset must be readable 
by the pandas read_csv function. This includes .txt files. The second variable is the name 
of a new file that will be the plot. Include the file type in this variable (ex: .pdf). 
The default file type is .png. 

The program takes the dataset you wish to plot, and makes a basic line plot from the data.
This plot is saved as a figure in the location your terminal is located in.
