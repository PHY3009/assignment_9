This script is a python function that takes the dataset for my final project and 
produces a time-series plot of significant wave height over the first 10 hours of 
recording. This extremely specific function only requires a command-line input of the 
input data file (my environment Canada data) and the output file that the plot is to be 
saved to. These command-line inputs need to be in this respective order, and the input 
data file must be in csv format for the function to perform. Moreover, the only 
command-line inputs necessary to run this function are specifying that the bash shell 
should be in python, then commanding the functions operation by calling the name of the 
saved script file (tplot.py), then finally calling the input data file and output saved 
plot file. It should be noted that the plot will be saved in the current working directory 
unless the output file name is accompanied by a different path either relative or direct.
