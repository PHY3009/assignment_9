The script uses the pandas, sys, and matplotlib libraries

First, the script assign the variables, which are the input files (dataset) and
output file (export the plot).
The script takes in dataset using pandas, and then plot the MEAN column of
the dataset (I'm using my own dataset). Then it saves the plot in the same
directory. It will also show the plot. 
The output file will vary on input file (the dataset), for example:
Changing the MEAN will allow users to choosing diffrent variables to plot within
the dataset.
