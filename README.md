# This is a script for creating a boxplot of the relative abundance of
#nucleotides in the spacers of a CRISPR array.
#given a csv file, where the first column lists the spacers, the second column
#lists A, third C, fourth G, fifth T, it will create a boxplot.
#It is supposed to name the file whatever the second argument is,
#this doesn't seem to be working.
#it takes input as argument 1 as the specified csv file, in the format
#outlined above.
