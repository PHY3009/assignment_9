This script loads a dataset into python and then plots and saves a figure.

To use the script you can call it from the Shell by typing:
python <name of the script> <input_file> <output_file>

The name of the script is script.py, the input_file is a dataset that you wish to plot a figure from. The input file must be in a 
simple text file format (.csv or .txt), with the values seperated by commas, in order for it to load in the script. 
The output_file is any name you wish to give to the saved figure that the script will produce. You can save this file in any format, 
however a .pdf file is recommended.
