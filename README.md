#Explanation of Script for homework


This script loads the dataset of the users choice, plot this data set using the matplotlib function and saves the figure produced from the dataset. Three main variables for this script are:

* input_file:  This is used to represent the dataset that will be worked with in the program
* output_file: This variable represents the name of the file where the figure will be stored/ moved to after the necessary codes are completed. 
* action: This variable is used complete calculations on the variable

Based on the load function, this script is most likely to load datasets separated by commas and those that are in a csv file format. This script can be used to print relatively large data sets seeing that the pandas 
function is the foundational library for the script. 
These functions are written using the loop framework as it first reads the file then performs the necessary functions. After Which it produces and output which in the form of figure which is later saved. To end this 
process the main() is applied.
