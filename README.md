# this script named make_it_happen.py is made to make a standard line graph. 
# to use this script enter in your command line after the $ python make_it_happen.py input_file output_file 
# input_file = your dataset and output_file = the name you want your graph to be saved under 
# this graph needs formated data to be entered in. Therefor if you add data that has more then one variable it will load the entire set of data and will not give your specific graphs. but a combination of them. 
# The data that should be used for this script should have one x variable and one y variable. it can plot more then one y variable but if the units are different it will not be apparent in the output_file. 
# another aspect of the input_file is that it must be a .csv file.
